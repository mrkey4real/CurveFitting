   ** Warning ** Output:PreprocessorMessage="GroundTempCalc - Slab" has the following Warning condition:
   **   ~~~   ** Slab thickness [0.122 m] reset to 0.122 m  for computational stability.
   ************* Beginning Zone Sizing Calculations
   ** Warning ** GetHTSurfaceData: Surfaces with interface to Ground found but no "Ground Temperatures" were input.
   **   ~~~   ** Found first in surface=CRAWLSPACE_WALL_NORTH_LOWER
   **   ~~~   ** Defaults, constant throughout the year of (18.0) will be used.
   ** Warning ** CalculateZoneVolume: The Zone="CRAWLSPACE" is not fully enclosed. To be fully enclosed, each edge of a surface must also be an edge on one other surface.
   **   ~~~   **   The zone volume was calculated using the floor area times ceiling height method where the floor and ceiling are the same except for the z-coordinates.
